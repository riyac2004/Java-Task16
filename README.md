# TASK 16: Executor Framework – Task Scheduler

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of the Java Executor Framework to build a task scheduling application.  
Instead of creating threads manually, the application uses `ExecutorService` with a fixed thread pool to efficiently manage and execute multiple tasks concurrently.

The system submits multiple tasks, monitors their execution, handles failures, and shuts down gracefully after completion.
